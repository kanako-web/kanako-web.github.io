    Making pdf files available for downloading:
    -------------------------------------------

    Don't Change: conf.py from: FILES_FOLDERS = {'files': ''}
    to:  FILES_FOLDERS = {'files': 'files'} as it breaks /files/assets/css/custom.css

    After the Nikola build, all the pdf files are placed into: /output/pdf/...

    Copy all pdf files into the /files/pdf/ folder. E.g. test.pdf

    For a click-able link to the file that opens the download dialog box:
     
    <a href="/pdf/test.pdf" download>Download the pdf file: test.pdf</a>

-->

### Click to download a pdf file...

<p>
  <a href="/pdf/test-en.pdf" download>
    <button type="button">Click to download test-en.pdf file</button>
  </a>
</p>
